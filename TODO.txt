understand slowness of setoid_rewrite with subrelations

setup typeclasses for properties of t, bt, T, bT.
-> better instances for compatibility proofs (Proper for T ?)
-> avoid sequences like  [apply (ftT_T _ par_t). apply (in_binary_ctx par).] 

arbitrary arity / dependent predicates

derive [mon X] as a sublattice of [X -> X]
